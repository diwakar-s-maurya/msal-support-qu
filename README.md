1. Run npm install
2. Run npm start
3. Change line 7, scripts\auth.js. toggling on this line between CLIENT_ID_WORKING and CLIENT_ID_NOT_WORKING makes this code work/not-work.

4. There is something wrong with the CLIENT_ID_NOT_WORKING app-registration. Kindly support in find out what is wrong, why it works for CLIENT_ID_WORKING only, fix CLIENT_ID_NOT_WORKING, so that the same code can work for both client ids.
